  <h3>X Character Guide</h3> 

  <img src="assets/images/X1.png" width="600"/>
  <div class="bio" style="width:500px">
    <h4>Bio</h4> 
    <p>Mega Man X is the eponymous protagonist of the Mega Man X series. He was the successor of the original Mega Man and is Dr. Thomas Light's greatest creation. X is a Maverick Hunter who fought alongside his partner Zero in order to maintain peace and stability in the world and protect humans and Reploids alike from Maverick Reploids, though X would like nothing better than the opportunity to stop fighting.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/ssx1.png" width="300"/>
  </div>

  <h4>Gameplay/abilities</h4>
  <p>X is the game's general purpose ranged trooper. His primary attack is shooting whatever weapon he currently has equipped. By holding down the attack key, you can charge your weapon; each weapon has a different charge effect. All special weapons run on limited ammo. The X-Buster does not have an ammo limitation.</p>

<!--
  <ul>
    <li>Extremely versatile, with an array of attack, defense and support options in team modes.</li>
    <li>Very strong late game, with some of the best Hyper Modes in the game.</li>
    <li>Access to OHKO moves (Hadouken, Shoryuken) to quickly dispose of powerful foes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cons</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Middling early game. Requires a lot of Metal upgrades to become effective.</li>
    <li>Reliance on charge shots for maximum effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Lacking in raw DPS and damage output, requiring flinches and Crowd Control to pull ahead in engagements.</li>
  </ul>
-->

  <h4>Weapons</h4>
  <p>See the weapon guide here for a guide to X's arsenal: <a target="_blank" href="weapons.html">Weapon Guide</a></p>

  <h4>Armors</h4> <img src="assets/images/Xweapons/armors.png">
  <p>X can use Metal (a currency earned on each kill) to purchase armor upgrades in the in-game upgrade menu. Different armor sets from the various SNES games are available. You can even mix armors from the different armor sets, though you won't be able to take advantage of set bonuses unless you equip all 4 armor pieces in the same armor set.</p>
  <p>See the armor guide here for a complete guide to X's upgrades: <a target="_blank" href="armor.html">Armor Guide</a></p>


  <!-- <h4>Raging Charge</h4>
  <p>By pressing SPECIAL immediately after dying, for 5 Metal. X will revive, refill his health, and gain the following properties:</p>
  <ul> -->

  <h4>Strategy/remarks</h4>
  <p>In general, X is extremely versatile, with a vast array of special weapons and armor available to choose from depending on the situation. Though primarly focused on ranged attacks, some special weapons allow for melee playstyles as well. As X, you should constantly evaulate the flow of the game, considering which weapons allies or enemies have equipped, whether a flag needs to be defended from heavy attack, or the distribution of characters on your team or the other. Many of his special weapons have indispensable support effects in team modes that no other character can provide. Overall a more strategic, defensive tactician.</p>
  <p>As X, you will want to make heavy use of charge shots, his primary distinguishing ability from other characters. Charge shots use a lot of ammo but tend to be very powerful and debilitating, often causing full flinch or large area of effect spells. While the DPS of charge shots is low due to the charge time, they are effective forms of burst damage and be quickly followed by uncharged shots for additional followup damage. Arm upgrades greatly increase the effectiveness of charge shots and should be prioritized in modes where kill count is the objective.</p>

 
  <!-- <h4>X matchup</h4>
   <p>When fighting another X, . Another thing you should keep in mind is your current health and ammo, and theirs possibly. If you are low on health it is ill-advised to fight a head-on battle. You should use charged shots, playing defensively, try to pick them off with off-screen shots, as you search for health. The same applies for low ammo situations. Note that if you have even one bar of ammo left, you can still do a charge, so make use of this tip as much as possible to squeeze out the most use of your remaining supplies!</p>
   <h4>Zero matchup</h4>
  <p>Zero was designed as an aggressive melee attacker while X is more of a ranged defender. As such, you should attempt to "kite" a charging Zero whenever possible (dash/retreat out of his melee range, quickly turn around and shoot, and repeat), especially with charged shots that will cause him to flinch, buying time. As mentioned previously, the foot parts are useful as they allow you to outspeed him and therefore maintain your distance while kiting. Watch out for ambushes from above or below, as Zero is very scary if he can get in your face unexpected. Weapons that can keep him away, such as Storm Tornado and Gravity Well, are also useful.</p><p>Bear in mind that Zero can reflect many of your projectiles (!) with his Z-Saber so avoid the X-buster, Chameleon Sting, Electric Spark, Shotgun Ice or Hadouken whenever possible. The last thing you want is to spend time charging a shot, only for it to come straight back and take you down!</p>
  <!-- <h4>Vile matchup</h4>
  <p>The most important thing to remember when fighting a Ride Armor Vile is to aim for his head. As X, depending on your weapon, you may need to jump for this. Weapons that can hit at flexible angles or home in on their targets are generally more effective against Vile, such as Homing Torpedo (which homes in on Vile's head). The foot armor parts also will help in outrunning him from his punch range. Always make sure you're out of Vile's punch range, and kite a charging Vile similar with how you would fight Zero. Once you're fully upgraded, a Hadouken will destroy the Ride Armor in one clean hit, leaving Vile vulnerable to being finished off. Remember that the Rolling Shield doesn't block melee attacks like Vile's punches or stomps, but it will guard against his stun shot and bombs. Finally, one of the most valuable weapons against Vile is the Strike Chain as it can yank him straight out of the Ride Armor. If a good Vile is causing trouble, don't hesitate to switch to this weapon.</p>
  <h4>Axl matchup</h4>
  <p>Axl is similar to X in that he is a ranged character, and so unlike with Zero and Vile opponents, kiting is not really an option. Axl's main difference is his lack of raw power per shot but makes up for this with much better aiming capabilities and rapid fire attacks. You'll want to combine fast and unpredictable movement with close range dives into his face accompanied with a charge shot - up close and personal, Axl has difficulty hitting his targets due to his minimum range.</p>
  <h4>Sigma matchup</h4>
  <p>The X vs Sigma matchup embodies the eternal struggle between good and evil. Both characters have the capability to effectively counter each other in a never-ending arms race. You'll make quick work of a Maverick that is weak to your current special weapon, so take advantage of good matchups whenever possible. On the flip side, Mavericks that your special weapon is weak to will maul you quickly, so be sure to switch out of it the instant you see the Maverick that counters your weapon. Unique to this matchup, X can earn the special weapon of a Maverick after defeating one, or fully replenish its ammo if he already has it, so you can aquire a large arsenal by hunting down Sigma's henchmen, though these extra weapons won't persist after your next respawn. Note that Sigma himself and his various forms do not have any weakness to any of your special weapons in MMXOD. Electric Spark won't do double damage to Commander Sigma, Rolling Shield won't do extra damage to Wolf Sigma, etc.</p>

<!--   <h4>Strategy/remarks</h4>
  <p>As Zero, you are an aggressive close-quarters-combat character. You close in on your opponents and quickly dispatch them with high-damaging attacks and combos. In team modes, you charge in the battle and let your ranged allies shoot unimpeded.</p>
  <p>As Zero, you should understand how each of your techniques work and string together combos whenever possible. For example, one good combo is Ryuenjin into Hyouretsuzan, as the former will bring Zero into the air and allow for a setup into the latter. You can then further combo the frozen enemy with a standard 3-slash attack, or if you're feeling lucky, a Raijingeki (though foes can mash out of the freeze if they're quick enough and aren't low on HP.) Another combo is Shippuuga into anything, taking advantage of the flinch to close in on foes more easily. You can also Rakuhouha aerial foes, bringing them down to the ground with the flinch, and catch their landing with a powerful move like Raijingeki, a 3-slash combo, or even another Rakuhouha!</p>
  <p>Overall Zero is a powerful character, but he does take some skill to use, like in the real games.</p>

  <h3>Vile Character Guide</h3>
  <img src="assets/images/vile.png" width="600" />
  <div class="bio" style="width:500px">
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Vile is a major antagonist in the Mega Man X series. He used to be a member of the Maverick Hunters and was ranked S-A Class in Sigma's 17th Elite Unit prior to his commander's rebellion against humanity. Due to being a borderline Maverick, he was removed from duty and detained, being freed during Sigma's rebellion so he can cause as much destruction as he wishes.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/ssx3.png" width="400" />
  </div>
  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>Vile is rather unique among characters in that he can summon and command various Ride Armors with his third weapon slot. Ride Armors have higher HP than Vile and can take hits for him; however, be careful, as enemies can aim at your exposed head in the cockpit seat to deal damage directly to Vile, who only has 16 bars of health.</p>
  <p>Vile does not spawn with any Ride Armors and it costs 5 Metal to summon a Ride Armor, so he must progress thorugh a match and earn kills before calling down the big guns. He comes with three switchable weapons: the Front Runner, the Vulcan and the aformentioned Ride Armor slot. In addition, SPECIAL button activates many secondary abilities, which tend to be debilitating traps and bombs that provide effective support for his regular weapons.</p>
<!--
  


 
  <h4>Ride Armor Types</h4>
  <p>Vile can choose between 4 different Ride Armors to summon in weapon slot 3. Once you've summoned a mech, use this weapon slot to recall it to your location at any time when you are out of the mech.</p>

  <h5>Normal Ride Armor (N-Type)</h5>
  <p>This is Vile's standard, trusty Ride Armor used in MMX1. It's the most well-rounded mech, combining power, speed and mobility. Vile's primary attack button is punching with the mech. This move comes out surprisingly fast and deals 3 points of damage with a full flinch, but it has a rather short range. You can also jump on enemies to deal damage to them as well. You can also dash in the mech. Press the down arrow key in the mech to duck and hide inside of it, which will fully protect Vile himself from all damage, but causes the ride armor to become stationary (but you can still punch). Also while ducking in his Ride Armor, Vile can toss his Napalm out of his mech with SPECIAL key, similar to outside of it when crouching. Vile can shoot his missile while in the Mech (but not ducking inside it) with the SPECIAL key. You can hover in this Ride Armor briefly by holding JUMP in the air, good for making jumps that might be just out of reach otherwise.</p>

  <h5>Kangaroo Ride Armor (K-Type)</h5>
  <p>A slower but stronger Ride Armor. Its spiked fists deal 4 damage on hit but swing slower than the normal Ride Armor. The punch can also be charged to fire a chain attack that can attack enemies further away, and the charge-up drilling will also damage enemies close to the Ride Armor. Dashing is possible while charging but you dash slower, and you can even dash when ducking and charging, but the dash speed is reduced even further.</p>

  <h5>Hawk Ride Armor (H-Type)</h5>
  <p>This Ride Armor has extended flight capabilities (hold down JUMP in the air to hover/fly, which runs on a fuel meter that recharges after landing). It lacks a punch, instead firing two fast moving missiles that travel straight ahead and deal two damage each. Missiles can also be shot straight down by holding DOWN key before shooting. This mech only has 24 bars of life, so be careful and use the mobility to avoid powerful attacks. You can also dive bomb foes with the stomp which can be an effective tactic against grounded foes that would otherwise be difficult to hit from the air with your missiles. You can also drop two of whatever Napalm Vile has equipped from the mech's feet, with DOWN + SPECIAL, though you only have a limited stock per mech. Note that this Ride Armor will short out and self destruct in 15 seconds if it submerges underwater.</p>

  <h5>Frog Ride Armor (F-Type)</h5>
  <p>This Ride Armor really shines in the water, where it can launch torpedos that home in on foes, as well as swim (hold down JUMP in the water to rise upwards, which runs on a fuel meter that recharges after landing). It's no slouch on the land either, where it excels at jumping, having the highest jump of all Ride Armors, and, naturally, being well suited for stomping on enemies. On land, it can only jump, not walk, but you will jump higher on every consecutive jump, for up to 3 jumps, and can jump further by holding down the DASH key. The torpedos won't travel forward when shot on land but will still drop straight down so you can drop them on enemies below you; combine this with stomps for extra damage output. Note that this Ride Armor only has 24 bars of life, so avoid taking too much damage if you can. It also has no arms so cannot punch. However, it comes with a ground pound move (DASH + DOWN in the air) which can crush enemies below you and send enemies in the air straight down. Even if it misses, grounded enemies will get knocked off their feet if they are close to the shockwave.</p>

  <h4>Vile MK-II</h4>
  <p>After dying as "normal" Vile, if you have 5 Metal, you can revive yourself on the spot as Vile MK-II (press the SPECIAL button on the respawn screen). Vile MK-II carries a missile rack on his shoulder, so he fires missile-type weapons much faster, and the default stun shot is also improved to deal 1 damage per hit. Vile MK-II also gains access to an additional special move, the health-leeching grab, that can be activated with DASH + SPECIAL. The grab's damage ignores defense boosts. You can shoot cannons, missiles and rocket punches at an enemy while grabbing them. Note that the grab will not work if done in a spot that would clip the victim into a wall or other obstacle.</p>
  <p>Vile MK-II also comes with a shield on his back that reduces damage from attacks from behind. If an attack deals one damage, it is blocked completely. The shield even protects Vile's back in Ride Armors. Try to take advantage of this passive trait whenever possible and turn your back to your enemies when your weapons or specials are on cooldown.</p>
  <p>As Vile MK-II, if you have 10 Metal, you can even summon the mighty Goliath Ride Armor! This armor functions similary to the N-type, except it deals more damage, has a dash punch (hold down ATTACK while dashing), and has a ranged attack (press the SPECIAL button in the mech).</p>

 <h4>Vile V</h4>
  <p>You can even revive as Vile V from MMX8. This is possible after dying as normal Vile (press the ATTACK button on the respawn screen) or as Vile MK-II (press the SPECIAL button on the respawn screen) for 5 Metal in either case.</p>
  <p>Vile V has a jetpack and can hover in the air by holding JUMP but this will drain your fuel meter. Fuel recovers when you land, much like Hawk armor.</p>
  <p>Vile V also has access to a powerful move, Hexa Involute, which can be activated by charging the SPECIAL button all the way to green level charge, and releasing. (If you want to fire your laser, release at pink level charge.) This move grants invulnerability and surrounds Vile V with six beams of electric beams that radiate from him and spin around him. While powerful, it drains his fuel meter entirely and his E-Bar quickly, but can be cancelled by pressing SPECIAL again.</p>
  <p>Vile V has a unique way in which he controls his Ride Armors. Much like in MMX8, he doesn't actually pilot them, but remote controls them. Once you summon a mech, you'll control both it and Vile V at once, unless the mech slot is active, in which only the mech will be controlled. You can jump on your mech to ride it while standing, which lets you attack with both the Mech and Vile at the same time. However, Vile V loses the ability to duck in his mech and thus is more offensive oriented when using ride armors. While on the mech slot, press UP to summon it to your current position and DOWN to deactivate it. It can be reactivated by switching back to the slot.</p>

 <h4>Vile Body Armor Upgrades</h4>
 <p>Vile has two armors he can equip at the cost of Metal, similar to X, in the Upgrade Armor in-game menu. Here are the armors below:</p>
 <ul>
  <li><b>Frozen Castle</b>: 3 Metal. By utilizing a thin layer of ice, this armor reduces damage by 1/8.</li>
  <li><b>Speed Devil</b>: 3 Metal. Increases Vile's movement speed by 10%. Unlike with X's boots, Vile's speed is increased everywhere, not just for ground or air dashes, and the speed carries over on dash jumps.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Axl Character Guide</h3>
  <img src="assets/images/axl.png" width="600" />
  <div class="bio" style="width:500px">
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Axl is the tritagonist of the Mega Man X series. He is a prototype of the New Generation Reploids with the unique ability to mimic the external and internal characteristics of anyone he encounters. Axl has had important roles in Mega Man X7 and X8, effectively making him the third playable protagonist of the Mega Man X series alongside Mega Man X and Zero.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/ssx4.png" width="400"/>
  </div>
  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>Like X, Axl is a ranged character that can switch between various weapons. Unlike X however, he uses actual guns. These firearms can be aimed anywhere on the screen, and at any angle. Axl also has a unique Copy Shot ability which lets him transform into opponents, and even an assassination ability when disguised that can kill in one hit if aimed at the head.</p>
  <p>These qualities make Axl a "spy agent" type character with a specialist role on the team, using his aiming capabilities to assassinate key threats, and sneaking behind enemy lines while disguised to sabotage the objective.</p>
  
<!--

<h4>Controls</h4>
<p>Axl has two different aim modes that can be changed in Settings at any time.</p>
<h5>Aim Mode 1: Directional Aim</h5>
<p>Also known as "8 way" aim, this aim mode plays like a hybrid between MMX7 and MMX8 Axl, and is best for keyboard or controller players. Push the arrow keys in the direction you want to aim, and Axl will snap his aim to that direction. Release, and Axl will reset his aim straight forward. Press up+left/right to aim diagonally up, and down+left/right to aim diagonally down.</p>
<p>This aim mode supports an auto-aim mechanic similar to the one found in MMX7. Axl will automatically lock on enemies within a certain angle of your gun direction. This can be turned off in Settings. Note that unlike in MMX7, you can't cycle between potential lock-on targets, but you can cancel a lock-on by turning around, or pointing your gun away from the enemy.</p>
<p>In addition, this mode has two special key bindings: "Aim Key" and "Crouch". "Aim Key" allows you to activate a special aiming mechanism when held, configurable in Options. By default it is bound to LSHIFT. Here are the Aim Key Functions you can set:
  <ul>
    <li>Aim Backwards: This is the default. Hold it to have Axl point his gun backwards, good for running away while shooting a pursuer. With two-handed weapons like Blast Launcher, Axl will backpedal instead.</li>
    <li>Lock Position: When held, Axl will remain in place when aiming. You can bind this to the same key as the Shoot key for Axl to play like he does in MMX8, rooting him on the spot when firing a weapon.</li>
    <li>Lock Aim: When held, Axl's current aim direction will be locked in place, even if he had a lock-on target. As with Lock Position, consider binding it to the shoot key if you want to deal with fewer keybinds.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>The Crouch key is a separate keybinding specifically for Axl to crouch, as otherwise the DOWN key could conflict with AIM DOWN. By default it's bound to LCONTROL.</p>
<p>Note that if you're using a controller and bind the aim controls to an analog stick, and set the analog setting to "yes" in Settings, Axl will aim his gun at the exact angle you push the analog stick in, allowing for 360 aim, unlike with keyboard keys or a D-Pad. This makes this control scheme the optimal one for analog stick controller players.</p>

<h5>Aim Mode 2: Cursor Aim</h5>
<p>This aim mode involves moving a cursor on the screen, and allows you to play Axl with a mouse, much like a third person shooter. By default you use WASD for movement, Space to jump, and Left Shift to dash. The cursor can be moved with mouse or the Axl aim bindings in Controls menu. For the mode's keyboard controls, this control scheme has its own control binding in the controls menu, "Keyboard (Axl Cursor)". Note that you can use this mode with a controller as well, but it'll use the controller binding instead.</p>

<h4>Weapons</h4>


<h4>Abilities</h4>
<p><b>Copy Shot</b></p>
<p>With the Axl Bullet equipped, you can shoot Copy Shots with Right Mouse or SPECIAL button on controller. These deal more damage, but more notably, killing someone with the shot grants you their "DNA Core" in your weapon slot inventory. Switch to the DNA Core and press the shoot button to transform into that opponent, copying their name and equipped weapons/amor at their time of death! Up to 5 transformations can be stored in your inventory, and they are not lost on death. You can also preview a transformation's attributes such as the weapons, armor, ammo levels, etc with SPECIAL button with a transformation selected, before applying it.</p>
<p>When you activate a transformation, all your Axl weapon ammo will be replenished. While transformed as a character, you can use all abilities of that character, though the KBM controls are not rebound. You will also get two additional weapon slots: an Assassination slot and an Undisguise slot. Select the former and fully charge it up and release it on an unsuspecting enemy to deal 8 damage, or an instant kill if aimed for the head. Note that the headshot ignores any defense modifiers a character may have, and thus will always kill, except on players in invincibility states. This move will undisguise Axl once shot. Select the latter and use it to transform back into Axl immediately.</p>
<p>The Assassination slot and Undisguise slot have different behaviors if you press the SPECIAL button instead of SHOOT. For Assassination, you'll be able to immediately fire off a very effective "quick assassination" shot without having to charge, but at the cost of 2 Metal. For Undisguise, you'll be able to keep your current disguise in your inventory, again at the cost of 2 Metal.</p>
<p>In team modes, Copy Shot behavior is a little more special. You actually disguise as the player you killed, along with their team color! Use this ability to get behind enemy lines, capture the objective, and assassinate prime targets, without being noticed.</p>
<p><b>Hover</b></p>
<p>Axl can hover in the air for a short period of time. Simply press and hold the Jump key while airborne.</p>
<p><b>Dodge Roll</b></p>
<p>Axl can perform a combat roll by dashing while crouching, or by double tapping the dash key. This move grants invincibility frames for its duration but has a cooldown.</p>
<p><b>White Axl</b></p>
<p>This is a hyper mode much like Black Zero. Activate with 10 Metal by charging up the Copy Shot all the way and releasing. It lasts a limited time and allows Axl to hover indefinitely in the air. Activating White Axl also heals Axl and replenishes ammo for all of his guns. Each of Axl's guns also has a special power-up effect when used by White Axl.</p>

<p><b>Stealth Mode</b></p>
<p>This is a second hyper mode that can be swapped with White Axl in the loadout menu for Axl. It costs 10 Metal to activate, but drains it slowly over time, like Awakened Zero, and will not run out until Axl's Metal runs out. It can also be cancelled by charging up Copy Shot all the way. This Hyper Mode trades raw offensive power for defense and stealth, rendering Axl invincible to enemies while the effect lasts. However, Axl can still attack and shoot all his weapons while cloaked. Note that attacks while invisible temporarily reveal Axl for a short period, making him vulnerable to damage, so be careful. Try to use slower burst damage attacks like charged copy shots in this mode to reduce the vulnerability time.</p>

<p><b>Primary Weapon Crafting/Upgrades</b></p>
<p>The Axl Bullet can be upgraded in a match to a new gun (most of which originate from MMX Command Mission) by crafting with either DNA cores, Metal or both. To upgrade the Axl Bullet, go to Axl's loadout in a match and choose the weapon you want to upgrade to in the primary slot. Use WEAPONLEFT or WEAPONRIGHT to change between crafting recipies. Here are the weapons you can upgrade the Axl Bullet to:</p>

<p>Craftable weapons have limited total ammo capacity. This number will be shown below your Metal count in the HUD. The ammo bar will recharge over time but deplete this total ammo. Once it reaches 0, the ammo will no longer recharge and you'll have to buy more ammo in the loadout menu using the same recipies as the one you used to buy the gun in the first place.</p>

<p>Craftable weapons function similar to the Axl Bullet that they replace in many ways. They are still Axl's primary hand gun in slot one which is used for copy shot, assassination, etc. All craftable weapons can still fire copy shot which will not drain total ammo capacity, and obtain DNA cores with them.</p>

<p>Axl will keep any craftable weapons crafted and their current ammo capacity even after death. You can swap your craftable weapon (or back to the Axl Bullet) at any time. Do so if you run out of ammo and can't afford more yet. You can't active White Axl when using a craftable weapon but you can activate stealth mode.</p>

  <h3>Sigma Character Guide</h3>

  <img src="assets/images/sigma.png" width="600"/>
  <div class="bio" style="width:500px">
    <h4>Bio</h4> 
    <p>Sigma is the primary antagonist of the Mega Man X series. Once the noble leader of the Maverick Hunters, Sigma fell into insanity and turned Maverick himself, becoming the leader of all haywire Reploids and waging war on humanity. Although he has been destroyed countless times, Sigma's programming always survives and builds himself a new form, ready to menace the world once again.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/ssx5.png" width="500" />
  </div>

  <!-- <h4>Gameplay/abilities</h4>
   <p> </p>
  <p>See the Maverick guide here for each Maverick's arsenal and abilities: <a target="_blank" href="mavericks.html">Maverick Guide</a></p>

  <p>Pros</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mavericks allow Sigma to outnumber single enemies and gain an edge in low enemy count situations.</li>
    <li>Automatically earns Metal over time from Mavericks, making upgrades easy to afford.</li>
    <li>Reduced vulnerablity to flinch and Crowd Control.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cons</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large hitboxes means Sigma and Mavericks will take a lot of hits and die quickly in large crowds of enemies.</li>
    <li>If Sigma dies, Mavericks will retreat, making him a prime target for being focused down by enemies.</li>
    <li>Mavericks provide a lot of Metal to enemies upon defeat and can "feed" enemy teams.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Sigma Forms</h4>
  <p>In Sigma's loadout, you can choose between 3 Sigma forms, based on his appearances from MMX1 - MMX3. Each form has different moves and playstyle. Each also comes with a different Hyper Mode (based on the Sigma final boss forms from MMX1 - MMX3) that can be activated on death with 10 Metal.</p>


  <!-- <h5>Commander Sigma (X1 form)</h5>
  <p>This is Sigma's default form. Great for beginners as it's a good balance between offense and defense, as well as melee vs ranged.</p>
  <p>Commander Sigma's basic attack is swinging his formidable Beam Saber. It has longer reach than those of Zero and X, and deals 4 damage with full flinch, but has a long cooldown and ending lag. It can be used on the ground, in the air, when dashing, and when climbing walls and ladders.</p>
  <p>By holding down SPECIAL, Commander Sigma can shoot beams from his forehead, his primary ranged attack. You can aim the beams with the arrow keys. Each beam deals 2 damage, but it shoots fairly rapidly and has good range.</p>
  <p>Commander Sigma can perform a wall dash by pressing SPECIAL when sliding down a wall, causing him to leap off the wall at great speed. It can also be used from the ground with DASH + SPECIAL, but has a cooldown from the ground. It can be aimed up or down with the arrow keys. You can swing your sword during the leap to deal serious damage to enemies unfortunate enough to be in the way.</p>
  <p>Hold the DOWN key to guard as Commander Sigma. This reduces damage taken by half and allows him to block (not reflect) many projectiles. However, he can block a greater range of projectiles than Zero can reflect.</p>
  <p>Commander Sigma's Hyper Form is Wolf Sigma and is a 10-Metal revival-based hyper mode. Activate it upon death have Sigma's head pop off and attach itself to an enormous, fearsome wolf suit! Note that this hyper can only be activated in certain spots in the map if there is space, and away from the edges and other Wolf Sigmas. Wolf Sigma will give you three weapons in your inventory: the left hand, the head, and the right hand. The head weapon controls the suit, though it is immobile. While controlling the head, press the ATTACK key to sweep energy balls from left to right (or right to left if RIGHT key is held); each ball deals 6 damage with a full flinch. Press SPECIAL to instead shoot flames in the same manner, which do not flinch but deal 3 damage per hit + 3 burn. Switch to the hand weapons to control them and move them around, to reach enemies off-screen. (Note that in modes with a capturable objective, the max movement range of the hands is limited, to prevent abuse.) ATTACK will swipe at an enemy with the paw, and can be aimed with arrow keys. SPECIAL shoots devastating electric beams up and down that deal 10 damage on hit, but this attack is slow and telegraphed. The hands are invulnerable, and can be used to protect Sigma's head hitbox, which is his only vulnerable point. The hands can also be climbed and ridden by enemies and teammates alike, and can even be used to hitch your allies a ride in team modes! Note, you can drop through a hand if you don't want to land on it by holding DOWN when falling onto it from above.</p>

  <h5>Neo Sigma (X2 form)</h5>
  <p>This form of Sigma focuses on melee and offense, much like Zero (in particular, K-Knuckle Zero which it is very similar to.)</p>
  <p>ATTACK swings his claws; press it again for a second swipe which will deal more damage and flinch foes. UP/DOWN ATTACK will make Neo Sigma dive up/down, damaging enemies above/below him. The up attack can only be used on the ground, and the down attack only in the air. Much like Zero, Neo Sigma has a bar that charges on damage taken. At half bar, pressing SPECIAL will unleash several electric balls, and at full bar, Sigma will unleash a powerful electric column. Both these moves grant invuln frames for their duration.</p>
  <p>Neo Sigma's Hyper Mode is Viral Sigma (the final boss from MMX2) and like Wolf Sigma is a 10-Metal revival-based hyper mode. Activate it on death to emerge as Sigma's true form: a sentient, floating computer virus.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Press ATTACK to have Viral Sigma shoot Mechaniloids. All Mechaniloids cause contact damage, are always FTD, and last 16 seconds. Use WEAPON LEFT/WEAPON RIGHT to switch between Mechaniloids:
      <ul>
        <li>Tiranos: Costs 3 Ammo. A tank with high HP and a ranged attack.</li>
        <li>Scriver: Costs 2 Ammo. A hopper with a strong melee attack.</li>
        <li>Fishern: Costs 2 Ammo. A fish that swims around and deals contact damage. Only usable in water.</li>
        <li>Tubamail-S: Costs 1 Ammo. A bird that flies into enemies, blowing up in the process and dealing heavy damage. Only usable out of water.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Press SPECIAL to have Viral Sigma shoot a beam straight down to the ground; it slowly loses range the longer it's held, but the range will recharge over time.</li>
    <li>Press DASH + ARROW key to have Viral Sigma tackle foes in the direction held.</li>
    <li>Hold JUMP when near an enemy to attempt to possess them. You'll need to hold it for about 2 seconds. If successful, Viral Sigma will possess the enemy player and take full control over them! However, you cannot use attack or special buttons on the possessed character; these buttons will instead cause you to stop possessing the victim. A possess lasts 12 seconds, but the enemy can mash buttons to regain control faster. A successful possess will also refill Mechaniloid ammo.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Doppler Sigma (X3 form)</h5>
  <p>In stark contrast to Neo Sigma, Doppler Sigma focues on heavy defense and ranged attacks from protected positions.</p>
  <p>This form comes with a passive shield that can block many frontal attacks, but is not active when attacking. ATTACK shoots fireballs at enemies which can be controlled up and down. SPECIAL has Sigma throw his shield at enemies which can be aimed upwards. Press DOWN to guard which reduces damage and slightly reduces your hitbox behind your shield.</p>
  <p>Doppler Sigma's Hyper Mode is Kaiser Sigma (the final boss from MMX3), a 10-Metal revival-based hyper mode. Activate it on death to emerge in an enormous battle body.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kaiser Sigma's only vulnerable spot is his head; attacks to the body will be blocked.</li>
    <li>Use the ARROW keys to move/hover, and press UP to rise. When in the air, press JUMP to land back to the ground, crushing enemies beneath your feet with massive damage.</li>
    <li>ATTACK shoots a beam which can be aimed up or down.</li>
    <li>SPECIAL shoots 4 missiles from the top of the battle body, which home in on foes.</li>
    <li>WEAPON L/WEAPON R shoots mines from the left or right of the battle body, respectively.</li>
    <li>Kaiser Sigma is so big that it can only be activated in certain spots in the map where it fits. However, once activated you can transform into the viral form seen in X3's ending by pressing DASH. You can then move the head somewhere on the map where Kaiser Sigma will fit and relocate the battle body. Be careful since the viral form is vulnerable and defenseless.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Mavericks</h4>
  <p>In non-1v1 modes, Sigma can have up to two Mavericks in his inventory. These can be configured in the Loadout menu. You can switch between Mavericks with WeaponL/WeaponR.</p>
  <p>All Mavericks have 24 HP. Mavericks, like Ride Armors, are immune to flinch, headshot and CC (crowd control) abilities. However, they are incapable of capturing flags or points; Sigma himself must seize the objective.</p>
  <p>Mavericks not yet deployed in combat will work behind the scenes to finance Sigma's war efforts, providing 1 Metal every 10 seconds. This special ability is called <b>War Economy</b> and is unique to Sigma. Note that the Metal income rate is reduced the more Metal you have.</p>
  <p>See the Command Modes below for how Sigma can use these Mavericks at his disposal.</p>
  <p>See the Maverick guide here for each Maverick's arsenal and abilities: <a target="_blank" href="mavericks.html">Maverick Guide</a></p>

  <h4>Tough Guy</h4>
  <p>All Sigma forms have a passive defensive trait called <b>Tough Guy</b>.This causes all flinches received to become mini-flinches, and grants immunity to mini-flinches.</p>

  <h4>Command Modes</h4>
  <p>Sigma has several ways he can utilize the Mavericks in his squad. These are represented as different "command modes" that you can change in Sigma's loadout. Each command mode has its unique strengths and weaknesses, so try to switch to the mode of command best suited for the current situation during a match. To streamline these modes, Sigma has an additional button input you can configure called the COMMAND BUTTON (default Left Control on keyboard). You can configure this in the Controls menu, if you scroll to the Sigma specific control menu. Here are the command modes below, and how they function:</p>

  <h5>Command Mode 1: Summoner</h5>

  <h5>Command Mode 2: Puppeteer</h5>

  <h5>Command Mode 3: Striker</h5>
  
  <h5>Command Mode 4: Tag Team</h5>
